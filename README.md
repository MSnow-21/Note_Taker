A note can be initiated by clicking the pen icon where the user is presented with an area to make a title for the note and a task for the note. Once a note is completed by the user, the user can the file save icon that appears after a note has been created. Upon saving the note is stored in the column next to the original note entry point. Notes can be deleted by clicking the trash icon on the note title. This program utilizes GET,POST, and DELETE API requests on EXPRESS.js to talk to the server and deliver the note content.
